# My First Blog Post

Published on: 15/03/2025

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, i will share my learning journey.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, i created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating a new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts! 

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more updates.
